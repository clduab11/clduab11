# 👋 Hey there! I’m Chris (aka @clduab11)!
CEO of Parallax Analytics | Legal tech insurgent | Builder of AI tools that probably shouldn’t exist yet | Yes, this was AI-generated, it'll be okay!

## 🧠 TL;DR — Who I Am

I'm a consulting practice manager, a legal professional, and overall? Someone who got tired of waiting for the future — so I'm trying to learn how to build it myself, with the help of numerous wonderful communities!

After a full career pivot, I now develop bleeding-edge AI systems for legal, business, and creative domains. Think: 10-container Docker stacks, LLM orchestration, real-time data scraping, and multi-modal magic — all duct-taped together with actual purpose; not just hype.

## 🔍 Things I Actually Do

🧠 Build AI-native apps like **The Patentizer** — a platform that fuses diffusion model math with USPTO patent data, visualizes uncertainty in 3D, and lets users chat with legal knowledge via Perplexity Sonar
🧱 Architect full-stack deployments (FastAPI + React/Next.js + Kubernetes + WebSockets + SSE)
🤖 Experiment with AGI-ish behaviors via multi-agent coordination and swarm logic
🛠️ Develop toolchains to automate client workflows (Clio, Zapier, GoHighLevel, Supabase, OpenAI APIs)
🧪 Prompt engineer across Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, and Perplexity, with prompt chains longer than some law briefs
📈 Hack on legal tech, business intelligence, and AI forensics with intent to *deploy*, not just tinker

## 🚀 Projects You’ll Find Here

- **The Patentizer**: Legal tech platform for visualizing patent similarity with diffusion-based uncertainty halos. Built for the Perplexity Hackathon.
- **LLM sandboxes**: Custom setups for multi-model testing, RAG pipelines, and embeddings search
- **Prompt curation kits**: Built to test, evolve, and track prompt performance like a scientist
- **Config files & dotfiles**: Because if you’re not tweaking your terminal, are you even trying?

---

## 🧠 Current Obsessions

- Building GPT-native user experiences (GUX)
- Creating playgrounds for AI agents to interact, learn, and f*ck around (with logs)
- Simulating legal reasoning across distributed knowledge graphs
- Understanding what happens when prompt chains break down — and why
