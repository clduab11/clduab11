ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @clduab11.  Navigating the wild west of AI/ML, one prompt at a time.  (Currently accepting applications for the role of "Experienced Guide.")

ðŸš€  Passionate about all things AI: development, machine learning, implementation, multimodal/RAG... you name it, I'm probably Googling it right now (sort of...Google feels very old-school, suddely!).

ðŸŒ±  Learning Curve: Steep.  Progress: Noticeable (sometimes).  If you see me talking to my computer, don't worry, it's just me debugging my understanding of neural networks. (Or maybe it's the neural networks debugging me... who knows anymore?)

ðŸ’¡  Currently exploring how to turn AI/ML magic into business solutions.  Think of me as a mad scientist, but instead of a lab coat, I wear a hoodie, and instead of bubbling potions, I have my AI playground(s), arena chats, and functions/pipelines at my disposal.

ðŸ¤”  How to reach me?  Uhhh... carrier pigeon?  Just kidding (mostly).  You can probably find me on Reddit (@clduab11) trying to keep up with the latest and greatest. Or, you know, send a message through GitHub...  I think I figured out how that works.

âœ¨ Fun Fact: My current AGI model for predicting the future involves a magic 8-ball and a "well, hold my beverage and check THIS out...".

**(P.S.  If you're an AI/ML guru, please be gentle.  I'm new here.  And by "new," I mean I still think "tensor" is something you use to measure muscle tension, and even THAT I didn't know because this .md was 95% AI-generated.)**
