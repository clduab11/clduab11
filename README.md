- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clduab11. I'm entirely brand new and have no idea what I'm doing! :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things AI development, machine-learning, AI implementation, and multimodal/RAG development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning uhhh, LOL learning? I'm just talking to AI and figuring stuff out as I go and doing the research in between.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me... uh, send me a message I guess? I don't really know a lot though, bear in mind! I try to stay on reddit to keep up-to-date on latest local model development and deployment (same handle).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I definitely don't know what I'm doing HAHAHAHA
